I often find myself forgetting things, even the experiences and emotions I was sure I would remember forever.

Growing up with social media, I used to share everything on my mind immediately, whether as a Facebook status or an Instagram story. While that captured my raw thoughts in the moment, I rarely looked back at those posts. When I did, I just saw how cringey and performative they were. I draw a conclusion that social media, despite what its creators claim, is not a good place to record genuine thoughts or memories.

After deciding to delete my social media in June 2025, I started thinking about an alternative digital home for my stories and experiences. This time, it will be less about performance and more about what I actually think and feel. The goal is to take the time to process my thoughts and write them down, so that years from now, I can look back and reconnect with the version of me who wrote them the life I lived.

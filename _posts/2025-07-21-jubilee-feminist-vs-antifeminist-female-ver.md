This Jubilee discussion episode was unexpectedly frustrating for me. I say 'unexpectedly' because I'd already seen the male version of the content, which I found fine and even, dare I say, entertaining. My language skills feel a bit limited for expressing everything I want to say right now, but I'll update this post in the future if I have a clearer idea of how to put it.

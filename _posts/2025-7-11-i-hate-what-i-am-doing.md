I hate what I’m doing.

I know it has meaning. I can realize its purpose, its relevance, and the impact it might have. But meaning alone isn’t enough. Just because something is meaningful doesn’t make it fulfilling.

What the world sees as important, or what others find purposeful, doesn’t always align with what resonates with me. Meaning doesn’t always bring motivation. You can understand the value of your work and still wake up each day dreading it. Right now, I’m surviving on borrowed meaning. I’m dragging myself through tasks that feel like they belong to someone else’s dream. I keep showing up, going through the motions, because that’s what responsible people do. Because quitting feels like failure, and failure feels like shame.

Every day feels like a slow erosion of self. I'm on pause. I'm enduring.

I’m dying in small, quiet ways, bit by bit, waiting for the day I wake up excited instead of exhausted, waiting for the day I get to do something that brings me real joy. 

Not just pride, not just purpose. 

Joy.

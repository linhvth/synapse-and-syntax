I hate what I’m doing.

I know it has meaning. I occasionally have to lecture myself on its supposed purpose and the impact it might have (althouh deep down I'm skeptical if it even exists). But just because something is meaningful doesn’t make it fulfilling, or at least this is true to me.

What the world sees as important, or what others find purposeful, doesn’t always align with what resonates with me. Meaning doesn’t always bring motivation. You can understand the value of your work and still wake up each day dreading it. Right now, I’m surviving on borrowed meaning. I keep showing up and going through the motions. Because that’s what people call "work ethic". And I love the idea of me practicing that (how unhealthy that sounds huh).

You could say I am compromising, and oh boy I am trying so hard to do so. It ends with every day feels like a slow erosion of self. I'm on pause while waiting for the day I wake up excited instead of exhausted. I wonder until when I could get to do something that brings me real joy. 

Not just pride, not just purpose. 

Joy.

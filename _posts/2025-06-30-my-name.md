Growing up, I was at war with two words: "Thi Hong." They form the middle of my Vietnamese name, Vu Thi Hong Linh, and as a child, I felt they were a liability.Looking back, I can trace this disdain to my simple desire to be a cool kid. To my young ears, "Thi" sounded hopelessly old-fashioned and was a constant source of playground jokes. The addition of "Hong" only made it worse, branding it with a rural quality that felt miles away from the modern identity I craved. In my mind, a cool kid could never be saddled with such a silly, rustic name.

Growingg up a little bit, when I attended an English class and learned that people had "English name". And I began to want an English name. I remember my first Facebook account named Linda Vu, as Linda was somethingg closest to my first name Linh. Then, during my highschool and college, I used the name Alana on professional website like LinkedIn. I thought it was normal, as everyone had another name for them, why shouldn't I?

Until I came to the US, I realized I dont really need an English name. "Linh" is really easy to pronouce for foreigners, and no one struggles call me by my true name. Of course, some rarely times, someone would mistake me as a Chinese, and writes my name as Lin or Lee, my last name then mistaken as Yu. And I don't bother. The fact that now using my name "Linh Vu" creates a sense of identity, as I don't have to "fake" or to perform to be someone else. 

The name is not just a name. It's an identity.
